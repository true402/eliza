## Hand review

Real data renders (stats, controls, seeded agent). BLOCKER: the 'Usage & Rates' banner heading is hardcoded text-white inside the tokenized cream BrandCard (instances/components/eliza-agent-pricing-banner.tsx:58) — illegible, as is the sign-in footnote; stat tiles are bg-black/60 islands. Desktop table area is empty below the fold controls while the mobile card list shows the agent row clearly. Systemic dark-port debt (#10725): the page carries dark-frontend hardcoded `text-white*` classes while the app-hosted shell renders the LIGHT theme (body launch-bg `#ef5a1f`, tokenized cream `BrandCard` bg-bg-elevated) — white copy lands on cream/white surfaces. ~895 `text-white` usages across 93 files under packages/ui/src/cloud; fixing is a theme-token sweep, out of scope for this evidence pass.

_Reviewed by hand from the committed desktop + mobile screenshots (rebased 69/69 green). Machine scan (report.json): no blue, no orange-hover violations, no console errors on this page unless noted above._
