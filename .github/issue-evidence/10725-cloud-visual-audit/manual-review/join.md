## Hand review

Signed-in agent-first join flow runs and lands on the designed 'couldn't connect' error state (provisioning POST answered 501 by the deterministic stub). BLOCKER: the error message copy is white-on-white — invisible around the avatar + 'Try again' CTA. Same hardcoded dark-theme text debt as the dashboard pages. Systemic dark-port debt (#10725): the page carries dark-frontend hardcoded `text-white*` classes while the app-hosted shell renders the LIGHT theme (body launch-bg `#ef5a1f`, tokenized cream `BrandCard` bg-bg-elevated) — white copy lands on cream/white surfaces. ~895 `text-white` usages across 93 files under packages/ui/src/cloud; fixing is a theme-token sweep, out of scope for this evidence pass.

_Reviewed by hand from the committed desktop + mobile screenshots (rebased 69/69 green). Machine scan (report.json): no blue, no orange-hover violations, no console errors on this page unless noted above._
