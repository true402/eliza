/**
 * response-field-transcript — tolerant parser + detector for the plain-text
 * "keyed field transcript" shape that models occasionally emit instead of the
 * canonical JSON HANDLE_RESPONSE envelope.
 *
 * The response-handler prompts the model with a set of named fields
 * (`shouldRespond`, `replyText`, `contexts`, `topics`, `emotion`, ...). The
 * canonical path is a JSON object (native tool call or JSON-as-text). But some
 * providers — notably cli-inference / claude-sdk warm sessions in *text mode* —
 * echo the field set back as a colon-delimited transcript:
 *
 *   shouldRespond: RESPOND
 *
 *   replyText: it's live https://example/
 *
 *   built it out at /workspace, go click around.
 *
 *   contexts: simple
 *
 *   topics: website build, aurora
 *
 *   emotion: none
 *
 * Two properties make this hard and were the root cause of issue #11712:
 *   1. A field VALUE can span multiple lines and can contain embedded blank
 *      lines (see `replyText` above — a URL line, a blank line, then more
 *      prose). Naive "split on blank line" segmentation drops the tail of the
 *      value or, worse, fails to recognise the shape at all so the WHOLE raw
 *      transcript falls through as the reply and is sent verbatim to the user.
 *   2. Because the JSON parser rejects it, the tolerant plain-text fallback
 *      treated the transcript as a "simple reply" and shipped the raw
 *      `shouldRespond: RESPOND\n\nreplyText: ...` block to the channel.
 *
 * The grammar here segments on the rule: **a field's value terminates only at
 * the next line that starts with `^<knownField>:`, never at a blank line.**
 * That preserves multi-line values with embedded blank lines.
 */

/**
 * Canonical field names the response-handler emits. Kept in sync with the
 * builtin field evaluators (see ./builtin-field-evaluators.ts). Used to anchor
 * segmentation: only these names delimit a new field, so a `value:` that
 * happens to appear inside prose (e.g. "the ratio is 3:1") does not split a
 * field.
