/**
 * Contamination Prevention — End-to-End Defense Tests
 *
 * Validates the three-layer defense against LLM contamination feedback loops:
 *
 *  Layer 1 — Quality gate (write boundary):
 *    ContentQualityGate blocks hallucinated/drifted content before DB write.
 *
 *  Layer 2 — generationDepth (read boundary):
 *    Content derived from LLM output (depth >= 2) is excluded from prompts.
 *
 *  Layer 3 — Embedding grounding (semantic check):
 *    Cosine similarity catches semantic drift even when keywords overlap.
 *
 * These tests exercise the full contamination lifecycle:
 *   Source → Generate → Gate → (would store) → Read back → Generate again
 *
 * Requires OPENAI_API_KEY for embedding-based tests. Tests that need embeddings
 * are marked with [EMBEDDING] in their names — they degrade gracefully when
 * the key is absent but provide stronger coverage with it.
