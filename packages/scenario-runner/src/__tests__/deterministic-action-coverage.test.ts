/**
 * Deterministic action-coverage gate.

 * The app exposes an action surface that we want exercised by zero-cost
 * (keyless) e2e scenarios in CI. This test keeps that promise honest:
 *
 *   - Surface integrity: the real action surface of each importable core plugin
 *     is read live (from `plugin.actions[].name`) and must match the checked-in
 *     manifest. A new/renamed/removed action breaks the build, forcing whoever
 *     changed it to acknowledge the action here.
 *   - Coverage registry: every action we claim to cover deterministically must
 *     still be referenced by a real scenario (no silent coverage regression),
 *     and the total only grows (count ratchet).
 *   - Stable-core ratchet: every stable-core keyless action is either covered or
 *     in a baseline that may only shrink.
 *   - Wiring integrity: every scenario file is actually run by the deterministic
 *     CI script — a scenario that exists but never runs is larp.
 *
 * Plugins import is static (top of file) so the heavy source transform happens
 * at module load, not inside a test where it would race the per-test timeout.

 * (`OWNER_SCREENTIME` only exists on darwin) and pulls `messagingTriageActions`
 * in from @elizaos/core, and browser needs a real Chromium/JSDOM stack.
 *
 * Without this manifest, adding a NEW action to one of these plugins would slip
 * through silently — it is neither live-imported (so CORE_ACTION_SURFACE can't
 * catch it) nor source-enumerated. This closes that gap by pinning the umbrella
 * action names each plugin declares in its own source. It is a drift-
 * acknowledgment surface, NOT a keyless-coverage mandate: a new umbrella forces
 * the author to classify it (cover its keyless slice in COVERED_ACTIONS, or
 * extend the LIVE_ONLY_REMAINDER justification) — it does not demand a scenario.
 *
 * Each umbrella's promoted virtuals (`BROWSER_CLICK`, `BLOCK_LIST_ACTIVE`, ...)
 * are intentionally out of scope: their names are derived at runtime by
 * `promoteSubactionsToActions` from a discriminator enum, so enumerating them
 * from source would mean re-implementing that transform here. The umbrella set
 * is the right-sized signal — a brand-new action is always a new umbrella
 * (`const ACTION_NAME = "X"` or a top-level `name: "X"`), which this catches.
 *
 * `files` lists exactly the action sources each plugin wires into its `actions`
 * array (verified against each plugin's entry). `actions` is the umbrella-name
 * set those files declare. Google wires `actions: []`, so its set is empty and
 * the empty-array literal is asserted to stay put.
