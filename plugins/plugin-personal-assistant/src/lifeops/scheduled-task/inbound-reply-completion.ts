/**
 * Deterministic inbound-reply completion for fired ScheduledTasks.
 *
 * When the owner replies in a room that has fired tasks awaiting them (the
 * same room the scheduler recorded as the pending-prompt room), the reply
 * itself is the completion signal for `user_replied_within` checks. Before
 * this hook the ONLY `evaluateCompletion` caller was the LLM verb action —
 * the planner had to notice the open prompt and route a verb, so a plain
 * "done!" reply left the task `fired` until the completion timeout skipped
 * it. This hook runs on `MESSAGE_RECEIVED`, matches the reply room against
 * each fired task's pending-prompt room, and evaluates the task's completion
 * check with the reply timestamp — no LLM in the loop.
 *
 * Scope guards:
 *  - owner messages only (`hasOwnerAccess`), never the agent's own outbounds;
 *  - only tasks with a `completionCheck` and a pending-prompt room matching
 *    the reply room;
 *  - the check itself decides: `user_replied_within` completes when the reply
 *    is inside its window; `user_acknowledged` does NOT complete from a plain
 *    reply (acknowledgment stays an explicit verb); `subject_updated` gets an
 *    opportunistic re-evaluation against the real subject store.
 *
 * Per-task evaluation errors are logged and do not block the message
 * pipeline — an inbound chat message must never fail because one scheduled
 * task row is broken.
